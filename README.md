## About

I've read [this][1] blog post on Reddit and tried to implement something that
could work as a configuration but has all the goods of a programming language.
I've used python because I am most proficient in it, but this could be created
in any language <sup>(maybe not intercal)</sup>.

This works by simply using python to generate a valid GitHub actions YAML file.
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Is there any?
